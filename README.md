our Adventur into the world of C# 

For at lære at bruge C# valgte vi at programmere en løsning på en opgave fra hjemmesiden www.codewars.com.<br/>
Udfordringen hed:<br/>

You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.
